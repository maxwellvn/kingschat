# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OAuth callback flow in the Flutter web application is currently failing with a 404 error when the OAuth provider redirects to `http://localhost:60650/callback.html`. This occurs because Flutter's routing system doesn't properly handle the static HTML callback page, causing authentication to fail after successful OAuth authorization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user completing OAuth authentication, I want the callback URL to be properly handled so that I can be redirected to the dashboard after successful authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OAuth provider redirects to `/callback.html` THEN the system SHALL properly handle the callback without showing a 404 error
2. WHEN tokens are received in the callback URL THEN the system SHALL extract and process them correctly
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message and redirect to login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OAuth callback to work consistently across different deployment environments so that authentication works in development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running on localhost THEN the callback URL SHALL be properly handled
2. WHEN the app is deployed to a web server THEN the callback URL SHALL work without requiring server configuration changes
3. WHEN the callback is accessed directly THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the authentication process so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the callback is processing THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL show a success message before redirecting
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message
4. WHEN the callback takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeout handling
